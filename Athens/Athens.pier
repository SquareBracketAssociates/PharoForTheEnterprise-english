!Athens


In this chapter we will present Athens a new canvas framework for Pharo.
Athens is an object-oriented vector modern graphics library developed by Igor Stasenko. 
It is not just a wrapper of a C-library but is based on an object-oriented design. 
Athens offers one API composed of Surface, Canvas, Path, Shape and Transformation.
It also sets the foundation for multiple backends (Cairo, openGL).


!! Why Athens
Before presenting Athens we want to explain briefly why we need such a new frameworks. First 
the rendering quality of the old approach is slowly damaging us. There is a need for a system to render vector graphics and not pixels. Second the current implementation suffers from an old design. There are too many canvases and they are a bit bloated. 

The old Canvas (the pre-Athens canvas)
-  methodDict size returns 88,
-  its coordinate system is fixed, and 
-  in many places are assuming that a canvas has direct access to pixels.


The AthensCanvas has the following properties
-  methodDict size returns 21,
- has a free transformation of coordinate system, and 
- in addition there is no assumptions about output media.

The goal of Athens is to define a core abstract API for Canvas and other elements such as Paint, Shape, Surface and Transformations. Then such APIs are specified for different backends. Currently Athens offers thetwo back-ends: Balloon and Cairo back-end. The Ballon back-end is the old default graphics back-end. What is important is that we do not want to get specific back-end specificities to creep into the API because we want to be able to apply Pharo graphics to new back-end fast.

!! A first simple example
Before going into the details, let us start with a first example to give you a feel of Athens. 
At the of this writing Athens is fully working in Pharo but it is not replacing the default morphic rendering. Therefore Athens proposes a little tools to see your drawings and be able to move them and zoom in/out them. 

[[[
AthensSceneView new
   scene: [ :canvas |
		canvas setPaint: Color blue.	
		canvas drawShape: (
			can createPath: [:path |
				path 
					absolute;
					lineTo: 50@0;
					lineTo: 50@50;
					lineTo: 0@100 ])
	];
    openInWindow
]]]

Once Athens will be the default rendering engine in Pharo, the ==drawnOn: aCanavs== methods will just use the same logic as the block of the example. Therefore there will be no change for you. 

The code snippet once executed and after some interaction with it should display the same as Figure *renderingOne*.

Now let us study a bit the snippet. It is a simple one. First we set the color of the paint using the message ==setPaint:==. Second we create a shape and draw it. To create a shape we use the message ==createPath:==. Note that a shape can be any objects that understand certain messages. 

In essence you got a first feel of Athens.

!! Main Archicture Players

Before showing in details the API using examples, we will present the main architecture elements of the Athens architecture: ==Surface==, ==Canvas==, ==Shape==, ==Paint== and ==Transformation==.






!! Canvas

The Athens canvas is a central object which is used to performs drawings on a surface.
















!!! About accessing the surface

Athens does not allow you to instantiate a canvas directly, instead you should obtain a ready for use instance as an argument in ==drawDuring:== message sent to an Athens ==surface==:

[[[
surface drawDuring: [:canvas | .... ]
]]]

In general you do not need to create a surface. The system should and will do it for you. Therefore once Athens will be the default graphics frameworks in Pharo, the surface will be managed automatically for you:  For the ones that really want to understand note that the surface is often a resource allocated and managed by the OS, so it should be protected from session to session (when you save an image or reopen it Pharo has to check and recreate a surface because the OS may allocate a new one in between). All this management will be hidden from you.


Once Athens will be integrate

Using canvas outside a #drawDuring: method is highly discouraged. Doing so may lead to unpredicted behavior/data corruption/image crash.


!! Transformations
There are two kinds of transformations in Athens: paint transformation (imagine that you want to have a tiled pattern color but rotated) and path transformation (to translate, rotate your shapes).

The canvas offers two messages: ==pathTransform== and ==paintTransform==. Both comply with the 
==AthensTransform== API whose main messages are: 

- rotateByDegrees: angle
- rotateByRadians: angle
- scaleBy: factor
- scaleX: xfactor Y: yfactor
- translateBy: aPoint
- translateX: x Y: y
- loadIdentity that makes sure that the transformation leads to identity 
- restoreAfter: aBlock. This method reestablish the transformation once aBlock is executed. 


[[[
 athensCanvas pathTransform restoreAfter: [
                athensCanvas setPaint: self form.
                athensCanvas draw ]
]]]


!! PaintMode

A paint mode controls how the incoming color (source) will be transferred to surface (destination).

To set a paint mode for a canvas, send a message with corresponding mode name to the instance of the ==PaintMode==.
PaintMode instances are available via the canvas protocol ==paintMode==. 

For example, to set an 'over' paint mode, use following:
[[[
	canvas paintMode over.
]]]

If you want to restore original paint mode after performing drawing operations, which may change it, use ==restoreAfter:== message, i.e., 

[[[
	canvas paintMode restoreAfter: [
		.. perform any drawing operations here..
		].
]]]

Since different backends may support different set of paint modes, the default implementation in ==AthensPaintMode== for all mode setters is to signal an error. To query a set of available paint modes, supported by backend, use ==availableModes== message.

!!! Displaying forms

Usually to display a form in Cairo you can use the ==Canvas>>fromForm:== but it is slow since it copies contents (form's bits) into new cairo surface. Therefore the trick is to cache the 

Need alex example here
[[[
athensCanvas pathTransform restoreAfter: [
 			  paint := canvas 
			  		   	 	cacheAt: self form
			  		   	    ifAbsentPut: [ self form asAthensPaintOn: canvas ]].
athensCanvas setPaint: paint.
athensCanvas setShape: ...
]]]



!! Tools

As we saw the AthensSceneView let you see rendered shapes.

[[[
AthensSceneView new
   scene: [ :canvas | 
   ....];
   openInView
]]]



Now if you want to use Athens to design new Morph what should you do especially since you may be worried that you will have to redo everything once we will shift to Athens. 
Athens offers a wrapper that let you define your draw methods using the Athens API and the wrapper integrates smoothly with Morphic default rendering. This approach is nice since to switch to full Athens you will just have to remove the wrapper and your morph will full work. 



==AthensWrapMorph==

Here we should give an example.
