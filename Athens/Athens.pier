!Athens


In this chapter we will present Athens a new canvas framework for Pharo.
Athens is an object-oriented vector modern graphics library developed by Igor Stasenko. 
It is not just a wrapper of a C-library but is based on an object-oriented design. 
Athens offers one API composed of Surface, Canvas, Path, Shape and Transformation.
It also sets the foundation for multiple backends (Cairo, openGL).


!! Why Athens
Before presenting Athens we want to explain briefly why we need such a new frameworks. First 
the rendering quality of the old approach is slowly damaging us. There is a need for a system to render vector graphics and not pixels. Second the current implementation suffers from an old design. There are too many canvases and they are a bit bloated. 

The old Canvas (the pre-Athens canvas)
-  methodDict size returns 88,
-  its coordinate system is fixed, and 
-  in many places are assuming that a canvas has direct access to pixels.


The AthensCanvas has the following properties
-  methodDict size returns 21,
- has a free transformation of coordinate system, and 
- in addition there is no assumptions about output media.

The goal of Athens is to define a core abstract API for Canvas and other elements such as Paint, Shape, Surface and Transformations. Then such APIs are specified for different backends. Currently Athens offers thetwo back-ends: Balloon and Cairo back-end. The Ballon back-end is the old default graphics back-end. What is important is that we do not want to get specific back-end specificities to creep into the API because we want to be able to apply Pharo graphics to new back-end fast.

!! A first simple example
Before going into the details, let us start with a first example to give you a feel of Athens. 
At the of this writing Athens is fully working in Pharo but it is not replacing the default morphic rendering. Therefore Athens proposes a little tools to see your drawings and be able to move them and zoom in/out them. 

[[[
AthensSceneView new
   scene: [ :canvas |
		canvas setPaint: Color blue.	
		canvas drawShape: (
			can createPath: [:path |
				path 
					absolute;
					lineTo: 50@0;
					lineTo: 50@50;
					lineTo: 0@100 ])
	];
    openInWindow
]]]

Once Athens will be the default rendering engine in Pharo, the ==drawnOn: aCanavs== methods will just use the same logic as the block of the example. Therefore there will be no change for you. 

The code snippet once executed and after some interaction with it should display the same as Figure *renderingOne*.

Now let us study a bit the snippet. It is a simple one. First we set the color of the paint using the message ==setPaint:==. Second we create a shape and draw it. To create a shape we use the message ==createPath:==. Note that a shape can be any objects that understand certain message.
