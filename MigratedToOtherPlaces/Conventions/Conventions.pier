!!Package naming conventions

Below a rough *EBNF grammar>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Backus%E2%80%93Naur_Form* of how Monticello expect packages and versions to be named (no spaces allowed anywhere):

[[[
Package     = PackageName VersionInfo
PackageName = Name "-" [ Purpose "-" ] [ Platform "-" ] Rest
VersionInfo = [ "." Branch ] "-" Author "." Version
]]]

!!!Package Name

|! Token   |! Required  |! Explanation                                         |! Examples                   |
| Name     | mandatory  | The top level package name                           | Seaside, Scriptaculous, ... |
| Purpose  | optional   | Present for tests or examples only                   | Tests, Examples, ...        |
| Platform | optional   | Present for platform specific code only              | Pharo, GemStone, ...        |
| Rest     | mandatory  | The second level package name (avoid $- in the name) | Core, Canvas, ...           |


For example, the package

- Seaside-Canvas contains the canvas implementation.
- Seaside-Pharo-Canvas contains the platform specific code of the canvas implementation.
- Seaside-Examples-Canvas contains example code showing of the canvas implementation.
- Seaside-Tests-Canvas contains the tests for the canvas implementation.

!!!Version Info

|! Token   |! Required     |! Explanation                                                                                                                             |! Examples                     |
| Branch   | zero-or-more  | The branch name starts with a lowercase letter and should not contain hyphens ($-). Several branches may be combined with periods ($.).  | issue123, configcleanup       |
| Author   | mandatory     | The author initials are a short sequence of lowercase letters.                                                                           | lr, jf, pmm                   |
| Version  | mandatory     | The version numbering starts at 1 and is sequentially counting upwards with every commit.                                                | 1, 2, 3                       |


For example, the version

- Seaside-Core-pmm.2 is the second version of the package Seaside-Core committed by pmm.
- Seaside-Core.configcleanup-jf.3 is the third version of the package Seaside-Core committed by jf into the configcleanup branch.
- Seaside-Core.configcleanup.extraspeedup-lr.69 is the version 69 of the package Seaside-Core committed by lr, and is possibly a merge of the branches configcleanup and extraspeedup.
