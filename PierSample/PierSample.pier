!!Chapter & Sections

A line starting with ==!== becomes a chapter heading. Use multiple ==!== to create sections and subsections

@chapterAndSections

To refer to a section or chapter, put an anchor (equivalent to \\label{chapterAndSections} in Latex) using the ==@chapterAndSections== syntax on a ''separate line''. Then, when you want to link to it (equivalent to \\ref{chapterAndSections} in Latex), use the ==\*chapterAndSections\*== syntax. Anchors are invisible and links will be rendered as: *chapterAndSections*.

!!Paragraphs and framed paragraphs

An empty line starts a new paragraph.

An annotated paragraph starts a line with ==\@@== followed by either ==todo== or ==note==. For example,

[[[
@@note this is a note annotation.
]]]

generates


And,

[[[
@@todo this is a todo annotation
]]]

generates a todo annotation that is not visible in the output.



!!Lists

!!! Unordered lists

[[[
-A block of lines,
-where each line starts with ==-==
-is transformed to a bulleted list, where each line is an entry.
]]]

generates

-A block of lines,
-where each line starts with ==-==
-is transformed to a bulleted list, where each line is an entry.

!!! Ordered lists

[[[
#A block of lines,
#where each line starts with ==#==
#is transformed to an ordered list, where each line is an entry.
]]]

generates

#A block of lines,
#where each line starts with ==#==
#is transformed to an ordered list, where each line is an entry.

!!! Description lists

Description lists are lists with labels:

[[[
;blue
:color of the sky
;red
:color of the fire
]]]

generates

;blue
:color of the sky
;red
:color of the fire

!!! List nesting

[[[
- Lists can also be nested.
-#Thus, a line starting with ==-#==
-#is an element of a bulleted list that is part of an ordered list.
]]]

generates

- Lists can also be nested.
-#Thus, a line starting with ==-#==
-#is an element of a bulleted list that is part of an ordered list.

!!Formatting
There is some sugar for font formatting:

-To make something ""bold"", write ==\""bold""==
-To make something ''italic'', write ==\''italic''==
-To make something ==monospace==, write ==\==monospace=\===
-To make something --strikethrough--, write ==\--strikethrough--==
-To make something @@subscript@@, write ==\@@subscript@@==
-To make something ^^superscript^^, write ==\^^superscript^^==
-To make something __underline__, write ==\__underline__==

!!Tables
To create a table, start off the lines with ==|== and separate the elements with ==|==s. Each new line represents a new row of the table. Add a single ==!== to let the cell become a table heading.

The contents of cells can be aligned left, centered or aligned right by using ==|{==, ==||== or ==|}== respectively.

[[[
||centered||centered||centered
|{ left |} right || centered
]]]

generates

||centered||centered||centered
|{ left |} right || centered

!!Links

!!!Internal Links and Anchors

@anchorName

To put an anchor (equivalent to \\label in Latex), use the ==@anchorName== syntax on a ''separate line''. Then, when you want to link to it (equivalent to \\ref in Latex), use the ==\*anchorName\*== syntax. Anchors are invisible and links will be rendered as: *anchorName*.

!!!External Links

To create links to externals resources, use the ==*====Pharo>http://pharo-project.org/*== syntax which is rendered as *Pharo>http://pharo-project.org/*.

!!Pictures

To include a picture, use the syntax ==\+caption>file://filename|parameters+==. For example the following snippet will add the image with the specified caption and numbering as shown below.


[[[
+Pier Logo with i in Red>file://pier-logo.png|width=50|label=pierLogo+
]]]

generates Figure *pierLogo* (Note that this reference has been generated using ==\*pierLogo*==).

+Pier Logo with i in Red>file://pier-logo.png|width=50|label=pierLogo+

!!Scripts
This is important to be able to add code to illustrate functionality. 
For this surround the code with three opening and closing square brackets: ==[[[== and ==]]]==.

= [[[
= foo bar
= ]]]


generates

[[[
foo bar
]]]

If you want either a label (to reference the script later) or a caption (to give a nice title to the script), write the following:

= [[[label=script1|caption=My script that works
= foo bar
= ]]]


which produces

[[[label=script1|caption=My script that works
foo bar
]]]

This script can then be referenced with ==\*script1\*== (produces *script1*).

This is another script (referenced as *script2*), with no caption this time:

[[[label=script2
foo bar
]]]

!!! Syntax Highlighting

You may want to specify the language of a particular script to get syntax highlighting:

[[[
[[[language=SQL
CREATE TABLE "topic" (
    "id" serial NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
    "forum_id" integer NOT NULL,
    "subject" varchar(255) NOT NULL
);
]]]
]]]

will generate

[[[language=SQL
CREATE TABLE "topic" (
    "id" serial NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
    "forum_id" integer NOT NULL,
    "subject" varchar(255) NOT NULL
);
]]]

!!Raw

If you want to include verbatim text into a page you must enclose it in =={{{== and ==}}}==, otherwise Pier ensures that all text appears as you type it.

A good practice is to always specify for which kind of export the verbatim text must be outputted by starting the block with =={{{latex:== or =={{{html:== (for now only LaTeX and HTML are supported). For example, the following shows a formula, either using LaTeX or an image depending on the kind of export.

[[[
{{{latex:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:1}
  \frac{1+\sqrt{2}}{2}
\end{equation}
}}}
{{{html:
<img src="equation1.png" title="Equation 1" />
}}}
]]]

This results in

{{{latex:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:1}
  \frac{1+\sqrt{2}}{2}
\end{equation}
}}}
{{{html:
<img src="equation1.png" title="Equation 1" />
}}}

""Take care:"" avoid terminating the verbatim text with a ==}== as
this will confuse the parser. So, don't write --=={{{====\begin{scriptsize}====}}}==-- but =={{{====\begin{scriptsize} ====}}}== instead.

!!Preformatted (less used)

To create a preformatted block, begin each line with =====. A preformatted block uses equally spaced text so that spacing is preserved.

[[[
= this is preformatted text
= this line as well
]]]

!!Commented lines

Lines that start with a ==%== are considered comments and will be rendered as such in the output document (e.g., in HTML, such a line would be surrounded by ==<!--== and ==-->==).
